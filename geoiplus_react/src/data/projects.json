Original algorithm was extracting frames based only on the frames per sec while new proposed algorithm was extracting based on various factors as well as analyzing frames blurriness. As a result, only best quality frames, reduced amount of frames, reduced post-processing time (2x-5x faster as compared to previous algorithm)."
